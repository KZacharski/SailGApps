# SailGApps
A script for installing GApps on Sailfish X devices with Android App Support. Code for different architectures and Android API versions is in different branches.

Thanks to ubuntuscofield on Sailfish forum for the original, outdated script which I modified to be compatible with Sailfish 4 fresh installs (not upgrades from Sailfish 3) and added compatibility with other devices (untested)
